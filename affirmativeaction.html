        <h1>The Facts Behind Affirmative Action</h1>

        <h2>What is Affirmative Action?</h2>
        <h3>Affirmative action is a policy implemented by institutions to promote diversity among their members based on factors such as race. This policy is commonly applied in the context of college admissions, where race is considered alongside other factors in the decision-making process. However, this approach has caused controversy within the Asian-American community, as individuals of Asian descent tend to perform well academically and are often over-represented in college admissions.</h3>
        <h3>According to data from 2019, Asians comprised only 5.6% of the US population, yet made up almost 21% of Harvard's incoming class of freshmen. This trend is observable across many top universities, leading some institutions to adopt policies that incorporate race as a consideration in their admissions processes.</h3>
        <h3>While some advocate for a colorblind society, arguing that race should not be a factor in any decision-making process, using race as a consideration in college admissions is not unconstitutional. This was established in the University of California v. Bakke case, where Allan Bakke, who was rejected from the Davis Medical School, argued that the institution's Pro-URM (underrepresented minority) policy was the sole reason for his rejection. The Supreme Court concluded that while racial quotas were unlawful, institutions can employ affirmative action policies that take race into account as one of many factors in their holistic admissions process.</h3>
        <h3>Thus, the legality of affirmative action is not a point of contention. However, the debate surrounding this policy centers on moral considerations.</h3>
        <h3>When discussing affirmative action, the term 'race' is often the focus of attention, when in reality, socioeconomic status should be the main consideration. It is widely known that the average African-American family holds less than 10% of the wealth of the average white family, and for Latino-Americans, this number is 12%. Therefore, affirmative action aims to provide opportunities to those who are disadvantaged through no fault of their own, due to their social class.</h3>
        <h3>It is important to note that Asian-American families hold a net worth of approximately $673,000 on average, which is almost 60 times more than the average black family. While we may face some disadvantages in the college admissions process, we are still statistically advantaged in comparison to other racial groups in other areas of life.</h3>
        <h3>For instance, a student born into a wealthy family may have access to resources such as prep courses and tuition, giving them an advantage over a student from a lower-income family who may have had to work harder to achieve similar academic results.</h3>
        <h2>Consider the Following Perspective:</h2>
        <h3>Imagine being born into poverty and having to navigate a society that is inherently stacked against you. You work tirelessly, perhaps holding down a part-time job in addition to attending high school, all while facing discrimination based on the color of your skin.</h3>
        <h3>You don't have access to prep courses, private tutors, or other educational resources that can make a significant difference in our academic performance. Furthermore, the schools in your state are funded through property taxes, meaning that your school is overcrowded and underfunded, leaving you with fewer opportunities to succeed.</h3>
        <h3>Yet, despite these challenges, the moment college admissions attempt to even slightly level the playing field, it is met with backlash. Many Asian-American students who may not have been admitted to a prestigious university blame affirmative action policies for "stealing their spot", when in reality, it is often the result of wealthy families leveraging their influence through legacy admissions or other means.</h3>
        <h3>It is important to acknowledge the systemic barriers that exist for marginalized communities, and the role that affirmative action policies can play in promoting diversity and providing opportunities for those who have historically been excluded. Blaming these policies for individual rejection letters ignores the larger societal forces at play and only serves to perpetuate inequality.</h3>
        <h3>However, it is crucial to recognize that getting rid of affirmative action would be a mistake. Legacy admissions, which favor applicants with familial connections to the institution, are an example of a far more problematic system that still exists within the college admissions process. Therefore, abolishing affirmative action in favor of this antiquated approach would be a step backward in ensuring equal access to educational opportunities.</h3>
        <h3>Legacy admissions refer to a practice whereby certain applicants are given preferential treatment in college admissions if their family members or ancestors attended the same institution. This practice has come under scrutiny due to its tendency to disproportionately benefit wealthy, white students at the expense of minorities and those from low-income backgrounds.</h3>
        <h3>According to the U.S. Department of Education, a mere 41% of African-Americans are first-generation college students, making legacy admissions an inherently unfair practice that works against the principles of meritocracy and equal opportunity.</h3>
        <h3>Some proponents of legacy admissions argue that it is not inherently racist because it is not intentionally discriminatory. However, this argument fails to recognize that the outcomes of legacy admissions are highly unequal, which is an issue that is not limited to race. This type of justification for unequal outcomes is reminiscent of those used to deny the existence of systemic racism and other forms of institutional bias.</h3>
        <h3>An example of this is the Grandfather Law, a policy passed in Louisiana following the end of the Civil War, which stipulated that an individual could only vote if their grandfather was eligible to vote. Although the law made no explicit reference to race, it was still discriminatory, as it disproportionately affected African-Americans, who were often excluded from voting due to pre-existing discriminatory practices.</h3>
        <h3>Similarly, the racial disparities in legacy admissions suggest that it is a discriminatory practice that disproportionately favors certain groups. While the process itself does not explicitly mention race, the fact that it has been shown to heavily favor white, wealthy students is a clear indication that the practice is inherently biased.</h3>

        <h3>In contrast, affirmative action, while controversial, has been deemed legally permissible by the California Supreme Court in the landmark case of "Bakke vs. University of California." While it could be argued that affirmative action should be refocused to prioritize low-income students rather than race, the practice is still an important moral positive that helps to level the playing field for historically disadvantaged groups.</h3>
        <h3>Ultimately, the issue of legacy admissions underscores the need for greater scrutiny of admission policies in general, and a renewed commitment to fairness, equality, and diversity in higher education.</h3>
