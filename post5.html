        <h1>Why ‚ÄòBlacula‚Äô was Problematic</h1>
        <h4>By Kavin Ganesan (üìç Oakland, CA)</h4>
        <img src="https://i.ibb.co/QPyxPjK/DOCTYPE-html-html-link-rel-icon-href-httpsi-imgur-com-Mn-Ufy-Bc-png-type-imagepng-head-title-Sunken.png" alt="Article Image">
        <h2>Why ‚ÄòBlacula‚Äô was Problematic</h2>
        <h3>"Blacula," is a horror film that deserves some amount of criticism for its problematic aspects, primarily related to racism and its association with the blaxploitation genre. While the movie tried to provide a unique spin on vampires as a story, it inadvertently began stereotyping and reinforcing racial tropes that were prevalent in the era of blaxploitation cinema.</h3>
        <h3>One of the central issues with "Blacula" is its portrayal of the main character, Prince Mamuwalde, who becomes Blacula after being cursed by Count Dracula. This connection perpetuates the stereotype of black characters being cursed or condemned, reinforcing negative racial connotations. The use of a supernatural curse as a narrative device further entrenches the notion of blackness as something inherently problematic or undesirable. However, this is not the only example of racism within this film, in fact, it is quite minor when compared to other aspects.</h3>
        <h3>Furthermore, the film's depiction of Blacula's attraction to Tina, who he believes is the reincarnation of his wife Luva, raises concerns about fetishization and objectification. The portrayal of a black vampire fixated on a woman echoes racialized fantasies and plays into harmful stereotypes about black men's relationships with women. However, we should be thankful this time the trope was not conducted with a white woman. The black man/white woman trope has been historically problematic, perpetuating harmful stereotypes that have real-world implications.</h3>
        <h3>The film subtly explores the theme of passing, where individuals with lighter skin attempted to pass as white to escape discrimination. This is evident in Roz (Lynn Whitfield), Eve's mother, who navigates societal expectations more easily due to her light skin. The power dynamics between the French-descended characters and the white elite are also depicted. The film underscores the limited agency and vulnerability of these characters, highlighting systemic racism's broader impact.</h3>
        <h3>The broader context of "Blacula" within the blaxploitation genre is also a cause for concern. Blaxploitation films of the 1970s often featured stereotypical portrayals of African American characters, relying on cliches and exaggerations. While some argue that blaxploitation cinema provided opportunities for black actors and filmmakers, the genre also faced criticism for reinforcing negative stereotypes and presenting one-dimensional characters. "Blacula," as a product of its time, cannot escape the influence of these problematic tropes inherent in the blaxploitation movement.</h3>
		<h3>The film's resolution, with Blacula's ultimate demise, also raises questions about the perpetuation of the sacrificial black character trope. Blacula's suicide, driven by the loss of his wife and the perceived futility of his existence, echoes a recurring theme in cinema where black characters meet tragic ends. This narrative choice contributes to a pattern in which black characters are denied agency and often exist only to serve as plot devices for the development of white characters or the resolution of the story.</h3>
        <h3>Overall, while "Blacula" attempted to offer a fresh take on vampires, its reliance on racial stereotypes, fetishization, and the broader context of blaxploitation cinema make it a problematic film. The portrayal of Blacula perpetuates harmful tropes associated with black characters, reflecting the racial attitudes prevalent during the time of its production.</h3>
